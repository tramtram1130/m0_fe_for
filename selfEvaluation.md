# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

It's a bit of a doozie, but I feel fairly confident. The syntax is still confusing and I always have to
tweak it before it returns the correct value.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I had a productive struggle with this. Just from first impression alone made me panicky, but if I examine
the issue, break it into smaller pieces, work on bits one at a time, I manage to complete the exercise.
I also had to research the length method for the final problem because I didn't know the method to count the
character length of a string at the top of my head.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need to practice and examine the way for loops and if statements are structured when an array is involved. It's not very intuitive for me and I need to further work on that.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

No other questions.
